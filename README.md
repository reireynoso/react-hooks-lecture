## What are React Hooks ðŸ¤”

- React hooks are functions that let us "hook" into React state and lifecycle features from function components.
- Hooks allow us to to manipulate the state of functional components without needing to convert into class components
- Hooks don't work inside classes(because they let you use React without classes)
- By using them, lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) can be avoided.

## Why React Hooks? ðŸ¤¨
- Cleaner and less code with functional components opposed to class components 
- Classes can be confusing with the concept of `this`. (Can be resolved through `bind` or arrow functions)
- Functional components can potentially have a better performance than Class 

## Goals
- [ ] Understand the syntax of useState()
- [ ] Understand the syntax of useEffect()
- [ ] Convert a Class component into a Function Component with Hooks

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
