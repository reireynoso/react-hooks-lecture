## What are React Hooks ðŸ¤”

- React hooks are functions that let us "hook" into React state and lifecycle features from function components.
- Hooks allow us to to manipulate the state of functional components without needing to convert into class components
- Hooks don't work inside classes(because they let you use React without classes)
- By using them, lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) can be avoided.

## Why React Hooks? ðŸ¤¨
- Cleaner and less code with functional components opposed to class components 
- Classes can be confusing with the concept of `this`. (Can be resolved through `bind` or arrow functions)
- Functional components can potentially have a better performance than Class 

## Goals
- [ ] Understand the syntax of useState() and how state can be implemented into functional components
- [ ] Understand the syntax of useEffect() and how it substitutes for lifecycle methods
- [ ] Convert a Class component into a Function Component with Hooks
